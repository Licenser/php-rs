# libphp rust bindings 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Licenser/php-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Licenser/php-rs)

A binding to libphp from rust. It is pulling out the php-sys from [hjr3's project](https://travis-ci.org/hjr3/php-rpm), and adds some rusty wrapping around it to reduce the boilerplate and need for unsafe.

## Thanks

A big thanks to Sara Goleman and her book _Extending and Embedding PHP_. Also thanks to the people that created bindgen. And most of all to @hjr3 for publishing php-rpm which a lot of the code came form.
